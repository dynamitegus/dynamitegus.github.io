<h1>About Me<br></h1>
 <h2 style="font-family:'Ubuntu'"><a href="./"><br><- back</a></h2>
<p>Hi, I am DynamiteGus, a teenager from a little place called earth. You may of heard of it.<br>
   I am a budding Programmer that doesnt really know what they are doing and I am interested in computers and other electronics. <br>
   I play a lot of minecraft among other games, and I use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on my laptop and I love linux<br>
 <br>
  <i>what else does this need, pronouns and that sort??</i><br>
 <br>
  If you really care, I dont mind what pronouns you use as long as they are either he/him, she/her or they/them.<br>
  Also if you care idk what sexuality I am yet.</p>
