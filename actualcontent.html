    <h1>omg actual content?????????</h1>
    <hr class="cspc">
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            there are much better ways of doing this, like idk setting up something with accounts and stuff but that is a bit to hard, so just adding to the html it is!
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr class="cspc">
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            i also couldnt tell you why the formating is being weird
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr class="cspc">
    <div class="card">
        it has something to do with the p tag making the non p tagged stuff format correctly.
    </div>
    <hr class="cspc">
    <div class="card">
        <p class="nmp">
            i think it is just the default formating of html
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr class="cspc">
    <div class="card">
        <p class="nmp">
            yep so i just added a css class(element?) that make the element p with the class of nmp have no margins and no padding.
            <br>its kinda annoying that that is how they work but then again if they didnt work like that then they would not be a paragraph, just a section of text.
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr class="cspc">
    <div class="card">
        <p class="nmp">
        also its really annoying that a newline in a p tag doesnt mean a new lne when rendering the webpage.
        <br>it means i have to type &lt;br&gt;
        <br> &lt;brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr&gt;
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr class="cspc">
    <div class="card">
        <p class="nmp">
        im thinking about using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> to do most of my formating bc i am lazy and it has most of the stuff done already, and it actually looks good.
